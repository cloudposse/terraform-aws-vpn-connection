# terraform-aws-vpn-connection [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5eab6e0418363a61f043294d) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpn-connection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpn-connection) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpn-connection.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpn-connection/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision a [site-to-site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) [VPN connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html)
between a VPC and an on-premises network.

The module does the following:

- Creates a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and attaches it to the VPC
- Creates a Customer Gateway (CGW) pointing to the provided IP address of the Internet-routable external interface on the on-premises network
- Creates a Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection and assigns it to the VPG and CGW
- Requests automatic route propagation between the VPG and the provided route tables in the VPC
- If the VPN connection is configured to use static routes, provisions a static route between the VPN connection and the CGW

We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpn-connection/releases).


```hcl
  module "vpn_connection" {
    source                                    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpn-connection.git?ref=master"
    namespace                                 = "eg"
    stage                                     = "dev"
    name                                      = "test"
    vpc_id                                    = "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
    vpn_gateway_amazon_side_asn               = 64512
    customer_gateway_bgp_asn                  = 65000
    customer_gateway_ip_address               = "172.0.0.1"
    route_table_ids                           = ["rtb-xxxxxxxx", "rtb-yyyyyyyy", "rtb-zzzzzzzz"]
    vpn_connection_static_routes_only         = "true"
    vpn_connection_static_routes_destinations = ["10.80.1.0/24"]
  }
