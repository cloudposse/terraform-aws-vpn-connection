Terraform module to provision a [site-to-site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) [VPN connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html)
between a VPC and an on-premises network.

The module can do the following:

- Create a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and attach it to the VPC
- Create a Customer Gateway (CGW) pointing to the provided Internet-routable IP address of the external interface on the on-premises network
- Create a Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection
- Request automatic route propagation between the VPG and the provided route tables in the VPC
- If the VPN connection is configured to use static routes, provision a static route between the VPN connection and the CGW

Exactly what it does depends on the input parameters. The module is designed to be flexible and can be used in a variety of scenarios.

- If you supply `customer_gateway_ip_address` and set `transit_gateway_enabled` to `true`, 
  the module will create a CGW, then create a VPN connection, and then assign the connection to
  the Transit Gateway identified by `existing_transit_gateway_id` and the created CGW
- If you supply `customer_gateway_ip_address` and set `transit_gateway_enabled` to `false`,
  the module will create a VPG and CGW, then create a VPN connection, and then assign it to the VPG and CGW
- If you do not supply `customer_gateway_ip_address` (set it to `null`) then the module will only create a VPG

The module also provides some options for adding routes to the VPC or TGW route tables. You need to use
the options that correspond to the kind of attachment point (VPC or TGW) you are using.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>

> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>

## Usage

```hcl
  module "vpn_connection" {
    source = "cloudposse/vpn-connection/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    namespace                                 = "eg"
    stage                                     = "dev"
    name                                      = "test"
    vpc_id                                    = "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
    vpn_gateway_amazon_side_asn               = 64512
    customer_gateway_bgp_asn                  = 65000
    customer_gateway_ip_address               = "172.0.0.1"
    route_table_ids                           = ["rtb-xxxxxxxx", "rtb-yyyyyyyy", "rtb-zzzzzzzz"]
    vpn_connection_static_routes_only         = "true"
    vpn_connection_static_routes_destinations = ["10.80.1.0/24"]
  }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
