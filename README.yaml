# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision a [site-to-site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) [VPN connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html)
  between a VPC and on-premises network

  The module:

  - Creates a Customer Gateway (CGW) pointing to the provided firewall IP on the on-premises network
  - Creates a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and attaches it to the VPC
  - Creates a Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection and assign it to the VPG and CGW
  - Adds the routes for the provided IP ranges you will need to access on the network and select the CGW as its target
