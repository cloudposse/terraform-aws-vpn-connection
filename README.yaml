# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision a [site-to-site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) [VPN connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html)
  between a VPC and on-premises network

  The module does the following:

  - Creates a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and attaches it to the VPC
  - Creates a Customer Gateway (CGW) pointing to the provided IP address of the Internet-routable external interface on the on-premises network
  - Creates a Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection and assigns it to the VPG and CGW
  - Requests automatic route propagation between the VPG and the provided route tables in the VPC
  - If the VPN connection is configured to use static routes, provisions a static route between the VPN connection and the CGW
